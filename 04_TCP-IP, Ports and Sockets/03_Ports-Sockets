#PORTS and SOCKETS

Ports and sockets are both used in computer networking to enable communication between processes or applications running on different devices.

A port is a logical construct used to identify a specific process or service on a device. Ports are numbered from 0 to 65535, with well-known ports assigned to common services such as HTTP (port 80) and FTP (port 21). When data is transmitted between devices over a network, the source and destination ports are included in the header of the data packet to identify the specific processes or services that are communicating.

A socket, on the other hand, is a combination of an IP address and a port number. When a process or application initiates a connection, it opens a socket by specifying the destination IP address and port number. When data is transmitted, the data is sent to the socket associated with the destination IP address and port number.

Sockets are used in client-server communication. The client opens a socket to initiate a connection with the server, and the server opens a socket to listen for incoming connections. When a connection is established, data is transmitted between the client and server using the sockets associated with the connection.

In summary, ports are used to identify specific processes or services on a device, while sockets are used to establish connections between processes or applications running on different devices. Ports are numbered and included in the header of data packets, while sockets are a combination of an IP address and port number used in client-server communication.
