#IP vs TCP

IP (Internet Protocol) and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) are both protocols used in the Internet Protocol Suite to facilitate communication between devices on a network.

IP is responsible for the routing of data packets between devices, while TCP provides a reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data between applications running on different devices.

In other words, IP is responsible for sending data from one device to another, while TCP ensures that the data is transmitted accurately and in the correct order.

IP operates at the network layer (layer 3) of the OSI model, while TCP operates at the transport layer (layer 4).

IP is connectionless, meaning that it does not establish a dedicated end-to-end connection between devices before transmitting data. TCP, on the other hand, is connection-oriented, meaning that it establishes a connection before transmitting data and ensures that the data is received correctly at the other end.

In summary, IP is responsible for the basic delivery of data between devices, while TCP provides additional features such as error correction, flow control, and congestion control to ensure reliable delivery of data.
