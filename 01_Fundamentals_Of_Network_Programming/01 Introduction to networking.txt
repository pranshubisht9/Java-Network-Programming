Networking refers to the practice of connecting two or more devices together so that they can communicate and share resources. 
Computer networking has become an essential part of modern life, enabling individuals and organizations to connect to the Internet, 
share data and resources, and communicate with each other across different locations.

Computer networks can take many forms, ranging from small local area networks (LANs) that connect devices within a single building, 
to wide area networks (WANs) that connect devices across multiple cities or countries. Networks can be wired or wireless, and can use 
a variety of different technologies to connect devices together.

Computer networking is typically based on a set of standards and protocols that define how devices should communicate with each other. 
The most widely used networking protocol is TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), which is used to connect devices 
to the Internet and to each other.

Some of the key benefits of networking include:

Resource sharing: By connecting devices together, networks enable users to share resources such as printers, storage devices, and 
applications.

Communication: Networks enable individuals and organizations to communicate with each other across different locations, using a 
variety of different communication tools such as email, messaging, and video conferencing.

Cost savings: By sharing resources and enabling remote work, networks can help organizations reduce costs and improve efficiency.

Scalability: Networks can be scaled up or down to accommodate changing needs, making them a flexible and adaptable solution for 
businesses of all sizes.

Overall, networking is an essential part of modern computing, enabling individuals and organizations to connect with each other 
and share resources and information.
