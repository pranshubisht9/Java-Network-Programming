Internetworking is the practice of connecting multiple computer networks together to create a larger network that can support 
communication and data exchange between devices on different networks. It involves connecting LANs or WANs using networking 
devices, protocols, and technologies to create a single, unified network that spans large distances and enables sharing of 
resources and communication between devices. It is essential for modern computing and has enabled the development of new 
technologies and services.
