Network topology refers to the physical or logical arrangement of devices, cables, and other components that make up a 
computer network. In other words, it's the way in which devices are connected to form a network.

There are several types of network topologies, including:

Bus topology: In this topology, all devices are connected to a single cable or "bus". Data is transmitted along the cable, 
and each device listens for its address and reads the data if it matches.

Star topology: In this topology, each device is connected to a central hub or switch. Data is transmitted from one device 
to another through the hub/switch.

Ring topology: In this topology, devices are connected in a circular or ring-like pattern. Data is transmitted in one 
direction around the ring.

Mesh topology: In this topology, each device is connected to every other device in the network. This provides multiple 
paths for data to travel, making the network more fault-tolerant and resilient.

Tree topology: In this topology, devices are connected in a hierarchical tree-like structure, with the root node at the 
top and branches below.

The choice of network topology depends on factors such as the size of the network, the number of devices, the level of 
redundancy required, and the specific needs of the network users.
