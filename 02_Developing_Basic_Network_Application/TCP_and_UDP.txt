TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are both protocols used for communication over the Internet.

TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, which means that it establishes a virtual connection between two devices before data transmission begins. 
This ensures reliable transmission of data, with acknowledgments and retransmissions of lost packets. TCP is used for applications that require 
reliable, error-free transmission of data, such as email, file transfers, and web browsing.

UDP, on the other hand, is a connectionless protocol, which means that it does not establish a virtual connection before data transmission. 
This results in faster transmission of data, but without the reliability and error correction mechanisms of TCP. UDP is used for applications 
that require fast, low-latency data transmission, such as online gaming, video streaming, and VoIP (Voice over IP) calls.
